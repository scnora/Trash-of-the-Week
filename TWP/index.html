    <h1>Welcome to Trash of the Week</h1>


    <h2>Preface </h2>
    <p>Have you ever wondered how much trash you dispose of every week? Have you ever even hesitated to throw something out? Well, I have. As I started attending college for the spring semester, I was looking for a parking spot in the yellow lot and noticed something interesting… The trash can on the corner of the sidewalk. It was filled all the way to the top, some even oozing out of the can. It was gross, and it made me wonder how much we truly consume.</p>

    <p>Trash of the week. I thought it was a fun idea to document how much I consume in a week, what their purposes were, and why I want to dispose of them. I felt like it would help me be more conscious of what I waste and to think twice of these things are truly worth throwing out or if they can be repurposed. It also made me think of the many stories behind a piece of trash and appreciate what it was once worth. </p>

    <p>Come join me weekly to talk trash! From an old gum wrapper to a toy that was donated, all of these things we call “junk”  had a purpose, and here I’ll be exploring these stories every week. </p>


    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This week, the trash of the week is different from any other week in the whole year. What makes this week different, you ask, well it’s because it’s the week when my birthday falls. Whether it's gift wrappers or birthday candles, lots of waste gets thrown out this week. That is why I wanted to share some of my birthday trash, along with some other finds whose lives have come to an end. I hope you like my trash and the stories behind it </p>

    <b>Birthday Bash, Birthday Trash: gift card, hair oil, phone case </b>

    <p>These are the items that came and go because of my birthday. Most of the reason why I am disposing of them has to do with the fact that I’ve used them already and their use is done. These items inclide a giftcard I received from my mom, an empty box that was the packaging for hair oil, and my phone case for my old phone. Starting with the giftcard, It is for the store Lululemon and It had $100 loaded on it. This was super exciting for me because I rarely get things that this store because it is usually expensive., but now I had an excuse to go, and money to use at it. I was able to get a nice pair of leggings and more, meaning the gift card has no more purpose. The cashier accidentally gave it back to me, despite it holding no more store credit, so now I am throwing it out this week. It had no value and was only taking up room in my wallet so it had to go. Next we have the packaging for the hair oil I got for my birthday. I am an Ulta Rewards member, and for my birthday month, they let me choose a gift item. I chose my favorite hair oil and started using it the same day I got it. Since the box is not necessary anymore, it will now be thrown out. 
        Lastly, we have my phone case. Since I got a new phone for my birthday, this case has no more purpose for me. This item felt the hardest to get rid of, especially since I’ve had it for so long. I was thinking of either trying to sell it on eBay for cheap or finding a friend who might have the same phone and giving it to them. Overall, these items had something to do with my birthday, and it is sad to see them go. </p>

    <b>The Broken Ones: earmuffs, bobby pin, foundation</b>
    <p>The second group of items I am throwing out this week are the broken ones. These ones were a bit harder to get rid of, especially since some of these items I’ve owned for a long time. These items include my earmuffs, my bobby pin, and foundation. First, the bobby pin, which I’ve had for who knows how long. I recently wore my hair up in a bun and used so many bobby pins to hold it in place. I usually keep my bobby pins and reuse them; This time, one of them got totally bent. I don’t know how this happened, but now there’s no use trying to fix or reuse it. Next item is my foundation, which I’ve had since senior year of high school. It’s the same foundation I used for my senior prom and for any fancy event. I’ve really loved it, however, I realized recently that it has expired. Its apparently not good to use expired makeup, and I'd rather not risk it, so I think its time for it to go. I’ll probably repurchase the same foundation, it is bittersweet to see it go. Lastly, the hardest one to get rid of is my earmuffs. I got them for Christmas 8 years ago, and they have been with me for many winters. 
        Since Thursday, I wanted to take them to school but when I went to go find them, the top part was snapped. I wasn’t even sure how it broke or why it happened, but I was truly devastated. </p>


    <b>Items Whose Life Span has Finished: gift receipt, ski lift, plushie</b>
    <p>The last group of items I will be getting rid of are the ones that I have to use for me. They are simple items that I don’t need and I would rather just get rid of. These items were the easiest in my opinion, to get rid of because they are not things I use every day. These items include a gift receipt, a ski lift ticket, and a plushie. Starting with the gift receipt, this was given to me by my sister in case I wanted to return an item she got me for my birthday. Since I never used it and I am happy with my gift, I don’t need it anymore. Secondly, I have a ski lift pass from when I went skiing with my boyfriend. I found it in my jacket pocket, and since I don’t need it anymore, I think I should just throw it out. 
    The last item in this group is a plushie I’ve had since 2020. I got it in an arcade machine, and I don’t really use it or need it. I feel like I don’t appreciate it as someone else could, so for that reason, I want to donate it. I feel like I have the tendency to hoard and keep things even though I don’t need them, and this year I want to be better with that. </p>
