    <h2 id="sec-des">Description</h2>

    <p>This is my old iPhone 12 Pro <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_case" target="_blank">phone case</a>.  I've had it since sophomore year of high school,
     and it's been on my person every day, 24/7 until now. On January 12th, 
     I received a new phone for my birthday. The iPhone I've been carrying around 
     with me and the phone case I trusted to protect it all those years will now be 
     of no use to me anymore. When I traded in my iPhone 12, I needed to remove all 
     the accessories that made the phone mine, including this case. It's a bittersweet 
     feeling, like I'm entering a new chapter, with a new phone and case. I look down to 
     pick up my new phone, but it feels so different, like a stranger. A part of me feels 
     bad throwing out the case, like I need to keep it for the memories,
     but I know that it has no use to me now and that I should move on. </p>

    <h2 id="sec-anc">Ancedote</h2>
    <p>"Let's go to Verizon", I heard on the afternoon of my birthday. </p>
        
    <p> My dad was putting on his shoes and telling me to get ready to leave but I was confused
         and overwhelmed by the sudden plans. "Your phone has been giving you issues,
        and it's time you update and trade it in before it's not worth anything anymore",
        but my phone was worth a lot, to me at least.</p> 
        
    <p> I didn't want to trade it in. It's been with me for so long, and my phone case has magically protected it for so many
        years of drops. The scratches on the cases where memories were attached to them and
        letting them go, felt like parting ways with a childhood best friend. It holds so much
        sentimental value that even though I'd be getting a new phone that would work fast and
        wouldn't die within 2 hours, I wasn't as excited as I should've been. It felt foolish to
        debate the matter, so I got in the car and cherished the last few moments with my phone
        and case. </p>
